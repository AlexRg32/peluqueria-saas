# Plan: Implement Promote Workflow

> Goal: Re-create the `.agent/workflows/promote.md` file to merge `staging` into `main` (Production).
> Architecture: AI orchestrator workflow standard structure.

## Foundation

- [x] **Task 1: Generate `promote.md`** — `.agent/workflows/promote.md`
  - What: Re-create the workflow file with proper MD structure, headers, and `turbo-all` annotation. Include steps for Pre-Flight checks, Merging, Cleanup, and Summary.
  - Verify: File exists at `.agent/workflows/promote.md`.
