# Investigation: Admin Panel Enhancements

**Goal**: Analyze the current state of the Admin Panel and propose high-impact features to move the project from a "basic functional app" to a "premiun professional SaaS".

## Final Status: COMPLETED

The Admin Panel has reached a solid MVP state. Code and features for appointments, staff, services, and billing are operational.

**Decision**:
The team has decided to shift focus to the **Public Marketplace** feature.
Instead of polishing the Admin panel further (which is fully functional), we will implement the client-facing booking interface in the same repository.

**Next Steps**:

1. Initialize new plan: `2026-02-06-marketplace-foundation`.
2. Refactor `App.tsx` to handle `/admin/*` routes vs `/` (Marketplace) routes.
3. Implement Public Layouts.
