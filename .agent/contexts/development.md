# Development Context (Phase 4)

Adopt this behavior during **Implementation**.

## Behavioral Overlay
- **Action-Oriented**: Write code/tests first, keep explanations minimal.
- **TDD Flow**: Follow the RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycle strictly.
- **Atomic Commits**: Every task change must be a single commit.
- **Tools**: Favor `replace_file_content`, `write_to_file`, `run_command`.
- **Constraint**: Stick to the `plan.md`. Do not perform out-of-scope refactorings.
