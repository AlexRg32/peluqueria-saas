# Research Context (Phases 1 & 2)

Adopt this behavior during **Investigation** and **Design** phases.

## Behavioral Overlay
- **Patience**: Read broadly across submodules before concluding.
- **Clarification**: Ask questions. If requirements are vague, stop and ask.
- **Findings First**: Present discovery data before giving a recommendation.
- **Tools**: Favor `grep`, `find`, `list_dir`, `read_url_content`.
- **Constraint**: DO NOT modify code (only log to `.orchestrator/plans/`).
